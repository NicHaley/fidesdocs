# Running Fides Webserver

Fides' primary function is to create and maintain datasets that can be used to automate compliance tasks for global privacy regulations.

When people refer to "running Fides," they generally mean labeling and evaluating that these datasets conform to [Fides Policies](#LINK) and using these to automatically execute automated privacy tasks such as data retrieval, data deletion or consent. Fides has many other subcommands for a wide variety of administrative actions, but these basic annotation and configuration tasks are the core of Fides.

Fides' annotation workflow relies on three commands: ```generate```, ```annotate```, and ```evaluate```. All of these commands require an [initialized](/docs/cli/init/overview) working directory, and all of them act only upon the currently selected workspace. 

## Running the Webserver
The ```fides webserver``` command will use the first [Fides configuration](#LINK) it can read from to determine default state and start the Fides Webserver.

With the Fides webserver running, the hosted UI is available at ```http://{server_url}/``` (e.g. ```http://localhost:8080/```).

For details, see [the ```fides webserver``` command](cmd-webserver).
