# Command: webserver

The ```fides webserver``` starts the Fides webserver using the available configuration and environment variables. By default, when Fides starts the webserver it:

* Reads the configurations from one of the following three locations:
	1. the config file passed via the CLI;
	2. the path specified by the ```FIDES__CONFIG_PATH``` environment variable;
	3. the current working directory ```.fides``` from the ```fides.toml``` file.
* Configures the Fides database if it is not already setup.
* Checks all current resources are valid.
* Makes the hosted UI available at ```http://{server_url}/``` (e.g. ```http://localhost:8080/```).
