# CLI Authentication

> Hands-on: Try the [Authenticate the CLI with Fides Server](#LINK) tutorial.

Fides is a platorm that performs automated privacy tasks, offering a collaboration-focused environment that makes it easier for teams to quickly comply with privacy together.

Fides CLI integrates with Fides Server in several ways â€” it can be a front-end for CLI-driven tasks on Fides Server, and can also rely on Fides Server for a variety of privacy tasks. All of these sensitive endpoints require you to authenticate Fides CLI with your Fides Server.

The best way to handle CLI authentication is with the login command, which help automate the process of creating an API token for your Fides Server.
