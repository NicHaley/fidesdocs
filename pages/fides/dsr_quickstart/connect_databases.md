# Connect Databases 

The Datasets panel allows you to easily view, add, edit, and configure [datasets](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/resources/dataset/), which represent your external databases.

## Adding a dataset 

Datasets can be added to the Fides UI by connecting to your databases. To add a new dataset, select **Create new dataset** from the Datasets panel.

You will then be given a list of options for creating your new dataset:

### Connect to a database 

To generate a dataset by connecting directly to a database, select **Connect a database using a connection URL**.

![Add A Connection](../../../public/assets/img/dsr_quickstart/add_database.png)

You will need to provide your **database type** from the dropdown, as well as the **database URL string.** 

Once the required information is entered, select **Create database**. Fides will display a success notification when the process is completed.
