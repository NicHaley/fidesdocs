# What is Fides

Fides (pronounced */fee-dhez/*, from Latin: FidÄ“s) is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code.

The Fides developer tools allow engineers and legal teams to label system privacy characteristics, orchestrate programmatic rights fulfillment, and audit stored personal identifiable information (PII) throughout application systems and infrastructure. This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/), [CCPA](https://ethyca.com/cpra-hub/) and [LGPD](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-new-brazilian-general-data-protection-law-a-detailed-analysis/)), and standards like [ISO 19944](https://www.iso.org/standard/79573.html) by default.

## Why is it called Fides?

Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for *"honor and credibility"* in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means *"reliability": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal*. Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software.
