# Installation Guide

## System requirements
See the the [Prerequisites and Dependencies](requirements) page for the minimum requirements.

## Installation options
The Fides team maintains a Python package [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fides/), and a Docker image on the [ethyca/fides DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides/tags).

### Using docker
The published reference images contain all of the extras and dependencies for running the Python application, but do not contain the required Postgres database.

Run the following command to pull the latest image from Ethyca's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides):

```
docker pull ethyca/fides
``` 

### Using pip
To install Fides from the published PyPI package, run:

```sh
pip install fides
```

## Set up your database
Configure your own Postgres database according to the configuration of your choice, ensuring it satisfies the project [requirements](requirements). Enable a username and password, and keep track of your connection credentials.

## Set up your cache
Configure your own Redis cache according to the configuration of your choice, ensuring it satisfies the project [requirements](requirements). Enable a password (via Redis [`AUTH`](https://redis.io/commands/auth)) to provide additional security, and keep track of your connection credentials.

## Configure Fides
Fides configuration variables are maintained in either a `fides.toml` file, or environment variables. These should be replaced with the connection credentials for your Postgres and Redis instances, as well as any other information unique to your deployment. 

See the [Configuration guide](configuration) for a full list of settings, and a sample `fides.toml`.

## Running the webserver
Once configured, you can start your server:

```sh title="Docker"
docker run ethyca/fides
```

```sh title="Python"
fides webserver
```

With the Fides webserver running, the hosted UI is available at `http://{server_url}/` (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`).
