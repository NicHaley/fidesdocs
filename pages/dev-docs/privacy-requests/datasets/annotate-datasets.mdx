# Annotating Datasets

In this guide, we will explore the process of annotating datasets which involves describing, to Fides, where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related so that Fides can traverse the data to fulfill privacy requests. 

## Step-by-step: Annotating data categories

Datasets may be annotated manually or using Fides Classify. This guides walks through annotating data manually in the following steps:

1. [Annotating data categories](/dev-docs/privacy-requests/datasets/annotate-datasets/annotate-categories)
2. [Defining the identity key for the dataset](/dev-docs/privacy-requests/datasets/annotate-datasets/define-identity)
3. [Define relationships between datasets, collections and fields](/dev-docs/privacy-requests/datasets/annotate-datasets/define-relationships)
4. [Skipping collections in privacy requests](/dev-docs/privacy-requests/datasets/annotate-datasets/skip-collections)
