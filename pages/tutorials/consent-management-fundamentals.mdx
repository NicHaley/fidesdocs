<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this tutorial we will briefly walk through what consent management is, how consent is served, why it's important and, how to automatically serve the approriate notices and gather consent for your users.

After reading this, you will be familiar with the key terms and concepts of consent management.

## What is Consent?

Consent in the context of data privacy and data governance is the need to collect consent from your visitors (data subjects) in order to process their data. 

For your organization to correctly comply with data privacy regulations you must ensure that you:
1. **Serve your users the appropriate notices** for how you process their data and,
2. Where necessary, based on location ensure that you **collect a record of consent**,
3. **Enforce consent** on all internal systems, business process and third party vendors

The full definition of consent under the GDPR is complex to understand but might be more simply stated as:

**Consent** is any freely given, specific and informed indication that a Data Subject agrees to the processing of their personal data for that given purpose.
