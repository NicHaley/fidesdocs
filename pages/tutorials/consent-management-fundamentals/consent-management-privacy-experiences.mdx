# Consent Fundamentals: Privacy Experiences

<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this page we will outline what privacy experiences are and the various types of privacy experiences available in Fides.

## Privacy Experiences
If notices are the text that is displayed to the user about your organization's data processing activities and the method of consent is the type of consent collected, you can think of the privacy experience in Fides as the way the notice and consent are displayed to the visitor - _their experience_.

**Privacy Experiences** are the user experience for how a visitor is presented with a privacy notice and consent.

The most common privacy experiences are:
* **Banner**: is more common in Europe (EEA) and is displayed to the user when they first visit the site, typically clicking on the banner allows a user to open a popup to personalize their consent setttings.
* **Privacy Center**: is more common in the United States and is available as a link in in the footer of all pages of a website, allowing a visitor to quickly access and personalize their consent and privacy settings.

### Banner Experience
The banner experience is most common in Europe (EEA) as a result of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, however it is also required for notice-only regulations in some other locations.

A banner ensures that the visitor takes action before any data processing occurs on site and as such is seen as good practice for collected explicity, opt-in consent.

An Opt-In consent banner features a text based noticed about your data processing activities, and three links that the visitor can use to interact:

* **Opt-In**: The "Accept All" option is where the visitor can agree and consent to all of the data processing activities.
* **Opt-Out**: The "Reject All"" option is where the visitor can object to all forms of data processing activities.
* **Manage Preferences**: The "Manage Preferences" option allows a user to customize their consent preferences for each data processing activity.

When a visitor clicks "Manage Preferences" a popup opens to display all privacy notices for your organization and a set of controls to allow the visitor to set their preferences, similar to the example below:

### Privacy Center Experience
The privacy center experience is more common in the United States as a result of the primarily opt-out nature of privacy regulations across US states.

Typically, the privacy center is paired with a link available in the footer across all pages of the web site. The text of this link may vary by location, however common labels include **"Manage Privacy Preferences"** and **"Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information"** as shown in the example below:

Clicking on the link takes the visitor to the privacy center, typically on subdomain of your brand website, such as: `https://privacy.your-brand.com`.

From here the visitor can view and update their privacy preferences:

Now that we've covered the fundamentals of privacy notices, methods of consent and privacy experiences, let's go through step-by-step configuration for each of these.
