## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.

You should also be familiar with the basics of the [Fides admin dashboard](#LINK).

## Getting Started with Data Mapping 
Fides is Ethyca's [Privacy as Code](#LINK) platform that lets you make privacy a default capability of your organization's technology and processes. Fides provides a quick and efficient way to build a data map allowing you to visualize sensitive data, identify privacy risks and generate compliance reports for global privacy regulations. 

In this series of tutorials, you'll add a new system manually to your data map and use Fides' Detection Scanners. You'll update your system's privacy activities, view your system on the data map and export a compliance report.

By the end of this series, you'll be able to build and manage your data map using Fides.
