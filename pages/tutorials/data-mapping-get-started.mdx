Fides allows you to quickly build a Data Map in order to visualize sensitive data, identify privacy risks and generate compliant reports for privacy regulations globally. 

In this tutorial, you will add a new system to your Data Map using Fides' Discovery Scanners, update your system's privacy activities, view your system on the Data Map and export a compliance report for a regulation such as the GDPR's RoPA (Record of Processing Activity) requirements. 

By the end of this tutorial you'll be proficient in how to add and manage systems and data to your Data Map as well as reporting.

## Prerequisites

For this tutotial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.

You should also be familiar with the basics of the [Fides admin dashboard](./docs/ui/).[TO BE UPDATED]

manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:

Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.
You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure.


The ```fides init``` command initializes a working directory called ***.fides*** and automatically creates a default configuration file called ```fides.toml```  using default values.
This is the first command that should run if you intend to configure Fides via a toml file rather than via environment variables.

Both methods can be used simultaneously, but note that environment variables take precedence over the ```toml``` file values. You can read more about [How to configure Fides](#LINK) here.

## Usage
Usage: ```fides init```

This command creates the default ```.fides``` directory and ```fides.toml``` config file using default configuration values.

Running this command should result in output that resembles the following:

```console
$ fides init

No config file found
Using default configuration values.
Loading config from: .fides/fides.toml
No config file found
Using default configuration values.
----------
Created a './.fides' directory.
Created a fides config file: ./.fides/fides.toml
