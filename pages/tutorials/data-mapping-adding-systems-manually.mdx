# Data Mapping: Adding Systems Manually

<TutorialKey duration="4" product="Fides" topic="Adding Systems Manually" video="true" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction

Fides is Ethyca's [Privacy as Code](#LINK) platform that lets you make privacy a default capability of your organization's technology and processes. Fides provides a quick and efficient way to build a data map allowing you to visualize sensitive data, identify privacy risks and generate compliance reports for global privacy regulations. 

In this tutorial, you'll add a new system manually to your data map and by the end of this tutorial, you'll understand systems, data maps and how to manage them in Fides.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.

You should also be familiar with the basics of the [Fides admin dashboard](#LINK).

## Adding systems manually

To start, navigate to **Data map** → **Add systems** and choose **Add a system** to add a system manually:

From here you can search the list of available system templates:

![Search for system templates](/fides/assets/img/tutorials/data-mapping-manual-search-system.gif)

Alternatively, to create a custom system, select **Create system** from upper right corner:

<Callout emoji="ⓘ">Using a system template will speed up your privacy operations as it uses Fides built-in privacy intelligence to prepopulate and and pre-configure integrations for privacy request processing.</Callout>

Create your system by completing the required **System details** on the **System information** tab as follows:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-name"></span>[System name](#system-details-name) - A unique and relevant name to identify the system on the data map and in reports.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-fides-key"></span>[System Fides key](#system-details-fides-key) - A unique key to represent this system across all Fides resources. This only accepts alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores, and may not contain spaces.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-description"></span>[System description](#system-details-description) - An optional description to help other users understand what this system is.

Next you will learn how to reduce manual data entry by using Fides' automated scanning and system discovery tools and then you will [add information to describe the ways in which you use data in your system](#LINK).
